    <p id="bio-p">Growing up, I had many wants and desires. I wanted to be an artist,
      live the rockstar life style, popping bottles-- all that crazy stuff. nah! just kidding.
      I wanted to join the art institute in order to learn how to draw better. Drawing was my passion, but
      that dream didn't last long after I discovered Runescape. In order to play Runescape I needed
      a computer. Luckily for me, my parents had bought a brand new Toshiba laptop,
      so I snuck off with it at night to play this game all my friends were playing at the time.
      I wanted and needed a way for my character to level up since I wasn't putting in as much play time
      as my friends were. I descovered that there were programs you could download as a sort of plug in that would
      play for you as a bot (but Runescape hates bots). I remember watching a bunch of code just move along the side of
      this program
      and as the code moved, my avatar in the game would move too. Watching that code made
      me want to learn how to code. Finally after years of pushing that desire to learn down, I decided
      to learn by joining the UC Davis Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.
      For those who read this far, <a

      Okay I agree that link could of been something better, but hey, it worked though.
